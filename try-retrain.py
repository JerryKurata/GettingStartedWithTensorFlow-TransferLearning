    try-retrain.py 

    This is a small demo program that shows how to use a retrained version of the 
    Inception model to classify images.

    To use the program:

    1. Update MODEL_PATH and LABEL_PATH to point to the where you wrote the retrained Inception Model
       and the output lables for your new classes
    2. Get a jpeg image you want to classify.  It must have a .jpg or .jpeg extension.
    3. Run this program with the command:
    
            python try-retrain.py <path to your jpeg image>

    This program is part of the Pluralsight course, "TensorFlow: Getting Started".  Watch that
    course for full instructions on using this program

    This program is a modified version of https://github.com/eldor4do/Tensorflow-Examples/retraining-example.py
